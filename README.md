Projects:


1. Baseball Statistics Calculator: A baseball statistics calculator built using Python that uses regular expressions (RegEx) to parse text files for baseball related data and then computes how many times each player on the team batted in the season and their batting average throughout the season. https://github.com/irtaza210/Baseball-Statistics-Calculator
2. COVID-19 Detection using X-Ray Images: Built a machine learning model using Keras & Tensorflow that trains a Convolutional Neural Network to identify & separate normal & COVID-19 patients on the basis of their X-Ray images. The obtained accuracy is 100%. https://github.com/irtaza210/COVID-19-Detection-using-X-Ray-Images
3. Cryptocurrency Portfolio and Price Tracker: A React application designed using Material UI which uses RESTful API and Chart.js to display real-time cryptocurrency prices & graphs & uses Firebase to allow users to buy, sell, and share cryptocurrencies with other users. https://github.com/irtaza210/Cryptocurrency-Portfolio-and-Price-Tracker
4. Doubly Linked List with Iterator: Built the Doubly Linked List data structure from scratch and a list iterator in C++ using pointers, references, copy control, explicit memory management, and C++ standard template libraries. https://github.com/irtaza210/Doubly-Linked-List-with-Iterator
5. Event Calendar: An event calendar built using JavaScript, RESTful API, SQL, & PHP that allows users to create, remove and update individual and group calendar events and share events with other users. https://github.com/irtaza210/Event-Calendar
6. File Manager: A file manager built using PHP, HTML, & CSS that allows users to upload, view, download, & delete their files. https://github.com/irtaza210/File-Manager
7. File System and Terminal using Object Oriented Programming: A simulated file system and terminal built in C++ using object oriented principles and design patterns that allow users to add, edit, rename, display, & delete public and password protected files using command line commands built from scratch. https://github.com/irtaza210/File-System-And-Terminal-Using-OOP
8. Gomoku and Tic-Tac-Toe using Object Oriented Programming: A program that allows users to play the popular board games Gomoku and Tic-Tac-Toe and is built in C++ using Object Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, refactoring and specializing. https://github.com/irtaza210/Gomoku-and-TicTacToe-using-OOP
9. Handwritten Digit Recognition using Multilayer Perceptron: Trained a Multilayer Perceptron to recognize handwritten digits using Keras & Tensorflow from a dataset of 60,000 images & by using NumPy library obtained an accuracy of 97% on the test data set. https://github.com/irtaza210/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Multilayer-Perceptron
10. Multi User Chat Rooms: A chat room application built using Node.js, Socket.IO, JavaScript, HTML, & CSS that allows users to chat publicly and privately with multiple users in multiple rooms. https://github.com/irtaza210/Multi-User-Chat-Rooms
11. News Sharing Website: A news website built using PHP, SQL, HTML, & CSS where users can create, read, update, & delete stories and add/delete/edit comments and like each story. https://github.com/irtaza210/News-Sharing-Website
12. Spotify Exploratory Data Analysis: A Jupyter Notebook that analyzes data of more than 175,000 songs on Spotify using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, & Pandas to discover what makes a song popular among users. https://github.com/irtaza210/Spotify-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
13. Studying Employee Attrition With K-Means: A Jupyter Notebook that analyzes an IBM employee attrition dataset & uses k-means and relevant Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, & Matplotlib to identify patterns in employee attrition to suggest which areas an HR department should intervene in. https://github.com/irtaza210/Studying-Employee-Attrition-With-K-Means/
